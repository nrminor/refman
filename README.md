# `RefMan`: a simple biological reference manager

Bioinformatics involves juggling lots of files, particularly reference datasets (FASTA, GenBank, EMBL, Oh My!) with associated annotation and genomic range data. `refman` evolved out of [our internal](https://dho.pathology.wisc.edu/) desire to simplify accessing references from many sources--both official and bespoke--as well as my own desire to write more RustðŸ¦€.

`refman` can be thought of as a simpler and less general-purpose implementation of what [SciDataFlow](https://github.com/vsbuffalo/scidataflow) does. For uses cases beyond getting a few reference datasets from disparate places, I highly recommend giving SciDataFlow a try. But if you're like me and your head is spinning with all the different combinations of all the reference datasets each of your projects needs, and you want a fast way of pulling these combinations together, `refman` is for you!

## Roadmap

`refman` is still a work in progress. Still on the roadmap are:

- [ ] black-box-, white-box-, and doc-tests
- [ ] link-checking with [lychee_lib](https://docs.rs/lychee-lib/latest/lychee_lib/)
- [ ] a GitHub workflow for generating releases so that static binaries are available
- [ ] potential API access to well-known repositories or other data stores
- [ ] expanded metadata fields or file formats
- [ ] validation that an entry in a given file format is actually that format
- [ ] stable config file format
- [ ] a global dotfile format with higher precedence than the tool's current defaults

If you're interested in speeding any of these or other features along, or find any bugs, please reach out in [the repo's issues](https://github.com/nrminor/refman/issues)!

## Installation

More coming soon. For now, assuming you have git available, are on a unix system, and have the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed, you can download and compile it from source with the following:

```bash
# download the source code with git clone
git clone https://github.com/nrminor/refman

# change into the project root directory
cd refman

# compile and install it onto your $PATH with cargo
cargo install --path="."
```

## Quick Start

Coming soon.

## Usage

Coming soon.
